### Hi, Iâ€™m John.ðŸ‘‹

I work at Apple as a software engineer since early 2018. Iâ€™ve been working as a software engineer for the last ten years in Silicon Valley / SF with a stint in management as well. My current focuses are building infrastructure software and distributed systems for large scale use cases.

My favorite programming language is Go. I went through a functional programming phase where I spent a lot of time working with Clojure for fun and later Elixir professionally. Iâ€™ve also spent time working with JavaScript and Ruby professionally to start my career. Before writing software professionally, I used php and Java for fun and to learn programming.

Iâ€™ve become a fan of statically typed languages over the years and my go to toolset is Go for any command line tools, agents, or rpc servers. Likewise, while I donâ€™t write web frontends as often anymore, my go to setup is to use Typescript with React if there is a web GUI component.

My primary IDE is vim and love that I have been able to use for the last 8 years while switching across many different languages and stacks with minimal configuration.

Fun Tech Fact:
I run my own virtualized Kubernetes cluster on a server in my home.
